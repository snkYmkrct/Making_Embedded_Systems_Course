Week 4 Homework - Air Quality project state machine

For the final project, I plan to build an Air Quality Monitor using the Stm32F429I disco board (using the touch screen interface), a SCD-40 Co2 sensor, a PMSA003I air particle sensor, a precise RTC, and addressable LEDs (Neopixels). 
The screen would display different data, based on user choice, and the LED would change color based on the values read from the sensors.
